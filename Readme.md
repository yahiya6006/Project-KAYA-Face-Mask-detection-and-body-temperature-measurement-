# Project KAYA

This is a collaborated project done by Yahiya Mulla, Khaleel Ahmed Lashkar, Akhilesh hiremath and Arif gadagkar.

This project does face mask detection and if the person is wearing the face face mask we will check his body temperature with MLX90614 sensor. To provide accurate body temperature we have used Neural Network to predict the actual body temperature based on the atmospheric temperature, distance of hand with respect to the sensor.
A youtube video describes the working of this project. To better understand about this project have a look at the youtube video from the link below.
